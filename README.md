# GRA4157

Course material for GRA 4157 - (Big) Data Curation, Pipelines, and Management

# Exams

**Mid-term exam (40%)** Technical knowledge, concepts from programming with data.

**The final exam (60%)**, is based on the two group presentations (1 - 3 per group) during the semester.

# Lectures

Lectures will be held each Friday 12-13:45 between August 25th and November 10th. You may contact me at steven@simula.no.

# Topics

**Part 1**

- Basic Python lists, dictionaries and operations.
- Reading from and writing to files, flexible solutions.
- Numerical python with numpy, arrays, array slicing for vectorized computations.

**Part 2**

- Working with the pandas library
- Reading data from websites
- Data visualisation

**Part 3**

- Cleaning data, combining data sets
- Machine learning workflows with scikit learn
- Assess machine learning models based on various assumptions on data (outliers etc)

# Written material

# Preliminary lecture plan

For a given lecture, the reading gives an approximate overview of what is expected to be known after the lecture. I expect you to solve the exercises after the lecture. Each week, we start the lecture with a student presentation of a exercise of choice. Send an email to vegard.vinje@bi.no to volunteer for an exercise. For exercises regarding pandas we refer to the w3resource (W3) https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/index-dataframe.php
