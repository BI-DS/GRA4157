# Preliminary lecture plan

For a given lecture, the reading gives an approximate overview of what is expected to be known after the lecture. I expect you to solve the exercises after the lecture. Each week, we start the lecture with a student presentation of a exercise of choice. Send an email to vegard.vinje@bi.no to volunteer for an exercise. For exercises regarding pandas we refer to the w3resource (W3) https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/index-dataframe.php
