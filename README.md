# GRA4157

## Mid-term grading
The maximum score was 12 points. One point was given per subtask. A total score between 0 and 100% was calculated and grades set on based on the grading scale below:
- A = 92 - 100
- B = 77 - 91
- C = 58 - 76
- D = 46 - 57
- E = 40 - 45
- F = 0 - 39

Course material for GRA 4157 - (Big) Data Curation, Pipelines, and Management.

# Preliminary lecture plan

For a given lecture, the reading gives an approximate overview of what is expected to be known after the lecture. I expect you to solve the exercises after the lecture. Each week, we start the lecture with a student presentation of a exercise of choice. Send an email to vegard@xal.no to volunteer for an exercise. For exercises regarding pandas we refer to the w3resource (W3) https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/index-dataframe.php
