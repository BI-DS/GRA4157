    "## Exercise 1: Odd or Even Number Checker\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand basic operations and command-line argument handling in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Write a Python program that accepts a number from the command line and determines whether the number is odd or even.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- For the number `4`, the program should output `The number 4 is even`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. The program should be executed from the command line.\n",
    "2. The program should initially accept only one argument.\n",
    "3. If the number is odd, print `The number [number] is odd`.\n",
    "4. If the number is even, print `The number [number] is even`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Error Handling\n",
    "* Handle potential errors:\n",
    "    - If the user inputs a non-integer and non-float value, print \"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\"\n",
    "    - If no arguments or more than the expected number of arguments are provided, print an appropriate error message.\n",
    "    - For the two-integer scenario below, if the second number is zero (which would cause a division by zero error), print \"Cannot divide by zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Enhanced Argument Handling\n",
    "* Modify your program to accept any number of command-line arguments.\n",
    "* For each argument, determine and print whether the number is odd or even.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Quotient and Remainder Display\n",
    "* If exactly two integer arguments are given, besides determining if they are odd or even, also print their quotient and remainder.\n",
    "    * Example: For inputs `7` and `3`, the output should include \"Quotient: 2\" and \"Remainder: 1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Float Handling\n",
    "* Extend your program to handle float numbers.\n",
    "* For float inputs, simply print \"The number [number] is a float.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* Look into the `sys.argv` list in the `sys` module to handle command-line arguments.\n",
    "* The modulus operator (`%`) and the `try-except` block will be useful for handling operations and errors respectively."

    "## Exercise 2: Filtering Even Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand list operations and conditional filtering in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Write a Python function named `filter_even_numbers` that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function should return `[2, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. The function should handle lists of any length.\n",
    "2. The function should return an empty list if no even numbers are found.\n",
    "3. The order of the numbers in the returned list should match their order in the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Enhanced Filtering\n",
    "* Modify the function to accept an additional argument `filter_type` which can be either `'even'` or `'odd'`. Depending on the value of this argument, the function should return even or odd numbers, respectively. If the `filter_type` is not provided, default to filtering even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Handle Non-Number Inputs\n",
    "* If the input list contains non-number elements, filter them out and return a list containing only the valid even or odd numbers.\n",
    "* Print a warning message for each non-number element encountered, specifying the invalid value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Performance Optimization\n",
    "* Consider optimizing your function to handle large lists efficiently. Think about the time complexity of your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. In-Place Filtering\n",
    "* Create another version of the function that filters the list in-place, i.e., it should modify the input list directly without creating a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* List comprehensions can be a concise way to filter lists.\n",
    "* The modulus operator (`%`) is useful for checking the parity of numbers.\n",
    "* For in-place modifications, consider using list methods like `remove`."

    "## Exercise 3: Counting Even and Odd Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand list operations, dictionary manipulation, and conditional counting in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Write a Python function named `count_even_odd` that accepts a list of numbers and returns a dictionary with the counts of even and odd numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- For the input list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function should return `{\"even\": 3, \"odd\": 2}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. The function should handle lists of any length.\n",
    "2. The returned dictionary should always contain both \"even\" and \"odd\" keys, even if one of the counts is zero.\n",
    "3. Ensure that zero (0) is counted as an even number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Handle Non-Number Inputs\n",
    "* If the input list contains non-number elements, ignore them in the count.\n",
    "* Return a separate count in the dictionary under the key \"non-numbers\" to indicate the number of non-number elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Enhanced Reporting\n",
    "* Modify the function to return a more detailed dictionary. Besides counting even and odd numbers, also provide the actual list of even and odd numbers.\n",
    "    * For example, for the input `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \"hello\"]`, the function could return:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      {\n",
    "          \"even\": {\n",
    "              \"count\": 3,\n",
    "              \"numbers\": [0, 2, 4]\n",
    "          },\n",
    "          \"odd\": {\n",

    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Performance Optimization\n",
    "* Consider optimizing your function to handle large lists efficiently. Reflect upon the time complexity of your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Count Other Number Types\n",
    "* Extend your function to count and classify prime numbers and non-prime numbers in the list. Return these counts in the resulting dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* A loop through the list with conditional checks can help tally even and odd numbers.\n",
    "* For prime number checking, remember that numbers less than 2 are not prime, and consider the factors of the number up to its square root."

    "**Objective:** Gain experience with file system operations, string manipulations, and data aggregation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: List Files in a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Write a Python function named `list_files` that accepts a directory path as an argument.\n",
    "2. The function should return a list of all files (not directories) in the specified directory.\n",
    "3. If the directory does not exist or an error occurs, the function should return an empty list.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Alphabetical Ordering\n",

    "1. Enhance the `list_files` function to return the file names in alphabetical order.\n",
    "2. **Bonus:** Make the alphabetical ordering case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The `sorted` function can be customized with the `key` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: File Extension Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write another function named `count_file_extensions` that accepts a list of file names.\n",
    "2. This function should return a dictionary where the keys are file extensions (e.g., \".txt\", \".pdf\") and the values are counts of files with those extensions.\n",
    "3. File extensions should be considered case-insensitively (e.g., \".TXT\" and \".txt\" should be counted together).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- The function should handle lists of any length.\n",
    "- If a file has no extension or starts with a dot (like \".gitignore\"), it should be categorized under the key \"no_extension\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "For an input list `[\"file1.txt\", \"file2.TXT\", \"image.jpeg\", \".gitignore\"]`, the function should return:\n",

    "    \".jpeg\": 1,\n",
    "    \"no_extension\": 1\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Enhance Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modify the `count_file_extensions` function to not just count files by their extensions but also list the actual file names under each extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Recursive Search\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhance the `list_files` function to search for files recursively in subdirectories. Include an argument `recursive` which, when set to `True`, triggers the recursive search.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercise 5: Time String to Seconds Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Enhance your understanding of string manipulations, time computations, and unit testing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Time String Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function named `time_to_seconds` that:\n",
    "    - Accepts a time string in the format \"hh:mm:ss\".\n",
    "    - Returns the number of seconds after time 00:00:00 as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Ensure the function can handle time strings where hours can be more than two digits (e.g., \"100:00:00\" for 100 hours).\n",
    "- The function should raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message for invalid time strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Consider using the `split` method on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function named `test_time_to_seconds` that:\n",
    "    - Tests the `time_to_seconds` function to ensure it works correctly.\n",
    "    - Use assertions to verify the expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Cases:**\n",
    "- \"01:00:00\" should return 3600\n",
    "- \"01:00:10\" should return 3610\n",
    "- \"01:01:01\" should return 3661\n",
    "- \"24:00:00\" should return 86400\n",
    "- **Bonus:** Include additional test cases, such as edge cases or invalid inputs, and ensure your function handles them gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use the `assert` statement to check that the function's output matches the expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Support More Time Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhance the `time_to_seconds` function to also support time strings in the format \"hh:mm\" and \"ss\", where:\n",
    "    - \"hh:mm\" should be treated as \"hh:mm:00\".\n",
    "    - \"ss\" should be treated as \"00:00:ss\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Time Overflow Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the time string represents a time beyond \"23:59:59\", the function should wrap around, simulating a clock reset. For example, \"24:01:01\" should be treated as \"00:01:01\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Comprehensive Error Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide detailed error messages for different types of invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer values, or invalid formats)."
